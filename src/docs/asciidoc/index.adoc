use of HTTP verbs.

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `DELETE`

|===

[[overview_http_status_codes]]
== HTTP status codes

RESTful characters tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`

|===

[[overview_headers]]
== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

include::{snippets}/headers-example/response-headers.adoc[]

[[overview_errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a character will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[overview_hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

RESTful Kollchap uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification[Hypertext
Application Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of
the API should not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described
links to navigate from resource to resource.
